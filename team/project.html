            3. Who are the target users of the app or apps? Are they more likely to be mobile or desktop users? Do
            they<br>
            have any other special characteristics or needs?<br>
            <br>
            Target users are the financially middle-class to lower-class people, eco-friendly pursuers, or students who
            are financially in need. They are more likely to be a mobile user while also having access to desktops or
            laptops.
            <br>
            -What basic, static information should be available through the app or apps? (For example, company name,
            address, contact info, etc.)
            <br>
            Rentta - for this project name. No other info required.
            <br>
            -What are some important design elements of the look and feel of the web app? Is there anything that the
            client does not want to see in the design of their web app?
            <br>
            The client want this design to convey a pleasant, eco-friendly, and cost efficient atomsphere
            <br>
            -What data does the client need to be managed and/or presented to the user? (For example, information on
            users, products, user-generated content, schedules, statistics, teams, leaderboards, user badges and
            trophies, etc.)
            <br>
            The client wanted to have a user system where someone can login and have a credit system. There are two
            types of users:
            The buyers: The people who have a bad record of maintaining the property they borrowed would have a low
            credit score in the system, a high credit otherwise.
            <br>
            The renters: Leads items and equipment; they would also have a rating system judging the amount of time
            they
            have registered as a renter, as well as how many items they have logged up, just like Taobao’s shop
            credit
            system. You may reference Mihuashi for this 2-type user system.
            <br>
            -Are there any simple interactive elements such as games, tools, or animations that users of their web
            apps<br>
            might enjoy or benefit from? (e.g., a mortgage calculator, a graphing tool, a simple game, etc. )
            <br>
            The client requires a user credit system from which the user will benefit when they’re selecting items
            to
            rent and buy each. As well as admin access to disable renter’s items or equipment if they are not up to
            regulation. Other than that, a recommendation algorithms that helps the related items being recommended
            to
            the top of the page based on the user preference would be prefered
